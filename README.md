PersonalPCRv1
=============

PersonalPCRv1 is a 2-tube arduino shield PCR thermocycler. Resistive heating, ambient cooling, No heated lid (say yes to mineral oil!).

PersonalPCRv1 was an open-source hardware collaboration between [Cofactor Bio LLC](https://web.archive.org/web/20120118133606/http://cofactorbio.com/personalpcr) and Templeman Automation LLC from 2011-2012. Cofactor wound down in 2012, Templeman wound down or severly curtailed operations in 2013. During operations, PersonalPCRv1 was available from Cofactor Bio for $149 + S/H. 

During 2012-13, the PersonalPCRv1 design evolved into an [8-tube strip resitive-heating / forced-air cooling thermocycler with heated lid](http://personalpcr.com) thanks to continued development at Templemen Automation. Later that year the company shut down and some of the developers tried to spin PersonalPCR off into a separate company. In May 2014 open-source harwdware reference files for PersonalPCRv2 were published at [personalpcr.com](http://personalpcr.com). Around this time, a new site was launched, MiniPCR.com. 

[MiniPCR.com](http://minipcr.com/), led by one of the original PersonalPCR developers from TA, manufactures and sells a thermocycler forked from the PersonalPCRv2 reference design. As of June 2014 they are unsure if they will continue the open-source tradition with their MiniPCR product. Assembled units start at $799.
